# Jenelle-Bootstrap-Portfolio
Jenelle's Portfolio using Bootstrap

## Description
One of the problems facing developers is time spent on writing code. This project makes good use of Bootstrap which is a CSS framework used to make webpages responsive. Compared to my last project using HTML and CSS-flexbox, I was able to complete in a faster time and my project does look more professionally laid out. I found the bootstrap framework very useful in laying out cards and making list. I would recommend this for beginners who may find writing code tedious or like me found flexbox "grid container" concept challenging.
